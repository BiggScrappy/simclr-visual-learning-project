Key Components 🧠 
Image Pair Generation: Positive and negative pair creation for Siamese-style training

Custom Visualizations: Radar charts summarizing insights, challenges, and the learning process

Hyperparameter Discussion: Observations on temperature, batch size, projection heads, and more

Troubleshooting Reflection: Notes on the sensitivity of contrastive learning setups

📘 What I Learned
SimCLR is highly sensitive to environmental setup and parameters

Minor code changes can significantly impact performance and output

Most of the implementation effort centered around debugging and visualization

Contrastive learning offers a dynamic, customizable approach to representation learning

⚠️ Challenges Faced
Fine-tuning augmentations and hyperparameters was critical

SimCLR’s reliance on large batch sizes required memory-aware implementations

The temperature parameter had a strong effect on contrastive loss behavior
